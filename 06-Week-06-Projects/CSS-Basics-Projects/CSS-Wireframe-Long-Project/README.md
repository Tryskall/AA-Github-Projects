Basic CSS Wireframe Long Practice
In this practice you will be using CSS to style the HTML that you have identified from the wireframe.

Set up
You can choose to use the HTML that you or your pair created in the HTML Wireframe practice, or use the one provided in this starter.

Instructions
Your main focus is to replicate the styling for components (button, links, paragraphs, headings, font-family, lists, grid) from scratch, based on the wireframe specs.

The project should look similar to the example images below.

Tip: Use the lorem ipsum generator to get lorem ipsum text used in the wireframe

Bonus: Add a grid that contains at least 4 elements at the end of your article as seen on the example below.

Bonus: Add CSS effects to your elements, like a color change when you hover over a button or a shadow effect to the nav bar.
