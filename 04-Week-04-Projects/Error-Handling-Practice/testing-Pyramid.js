// identify reasons why we write tests
// to modify the code with confidence
// tests are like documentation for the code
// clear expectations set for the code
// to make sure the code works
// easier collaberation
// to refactor code with confidence
// 

// What should your test specs cover?
// the function and pieces that will be used by other modules or classes

// True or False: According to the testing pyramid, the majority of your test specs will be unit tests;
// True

// True or False: According to the Testing Pyramid, the majority of your text specs test if a part of your code works in isolation
// False

// True or False: According to the Testing Pyramid, end to end tests are the slowest tests to run
// True

// Test Driven Development Quiz

// True or False: in TDD, you write tests specs first before you do and implementation.
// True

// Identify reasons to use TDD
// Reduce unnecessary functionality
// Code is guaranteed to be testable
// Make expectations of the code clearer
// Easier collaboration
// Code is more modular

// What is the RED step in TDD?
// Write test specs that fail

// what is the GREEN step in TDD?
// write a minimum amount of code until all specs pass

// What is the REFACTOR step in TDD?
// Refactor the code to make it more maintainable and easy to read while still passing all the specs

// Which TDD step should you start at when you want to add or modify expectations of the code?
// RED step
